/*
object oriented programming

classes & objects:
1. objects are entities on the real world.
2. class is like a blueprint of these entities.
3. by default all properties & methods are private inside the class.

access modifiers:
1. private: data & methods accessible inside the class.
2. public: data & methods accessible to everyone.
3. protected: data & methods accessible inside class & to its derived class.

oops have 4 pillars:
1. Encapsulation
2. Abstruction
3. Inheritence
4. Polymorphism

Encalsulation: if we take some properties and methods under class then these properties and methods will combinely called encapsulation.
